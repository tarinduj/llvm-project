/// This class implements a version of the Simplex and Generalized Basis
/// Reduction algorithms, which can perform analysis of integer sets with affine
/// inequalities and equalities. A Simplex can be constructed
/// by specifying the dimensionality of the set. It supports adding affine
/// inequalities and equalities, and can perform emptiness checks, i.e., it can
/// find a solution to the set of constraints if one exists, or say that the
/// set is empty if no solution exists. Furthermore it can find a subset of
/// these constraint that are redundant, i.e. a subset of constraints that
/// doesn't constrain the affine set further after addinf the non-redundant
/// constraints. Currently, this only works for bounded sets. Simplex can also
/// be constructed from a FlatAffineConstraints object.
///
/// The implementation of this Simplex class, other than the functionality
/// for sampling, is based on the paper
/// "Simplify: A Theorem Prover for Program Checking"
/// by D. Detlefs, G. Nelson, J. B. Saxe.
///
/// We define variables, constraints, and unknowns. Consider the example of a
/// two-dimensional set defined by 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0 and 2x - 3y >= 0. Here,
/// x, y, are variables while 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0, 2x - 3y >= 0 are
/// constraints. Unknowns are either variables or constraints, i.e., x, y,
/// 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0, 2x - 3y >= 0 are all unknowns.
///
/// The implementation involves a matrix called a tableau, which can be thought
/// of as a 2D matrix of rational numbers having number of rows equal to the
/// number of constraints and number of columns equal to one plus the number of
/// variables. In our implementation, instead of storing rational numbers, we
/// store a common denominator for each row, so it is in fact a matrix of
/// integers with number of rows equal to number of constraints and number of
/// columns equal to _two_ plus the number of variables. For example, instead of
/// storing a row of three rationals [1/2, 2/3, 3], we would store [6, 3, 4, 18]
/// since 3/6 = 1/2, 4/6 = 2/3, and 18/6 = 3.
///
/// Every row and column except the first and second columns is associated with
/// an unknown and every unknown is associated with a row or column. The second
/// column represents the constant, explained in more detail below. An unknown
/// associated with a row or column is said to be in row or column position
/// respectively.
///
/// The vectors var and con store information about the variables and
/// constraints respectively, namely, whether they are in row or column
/// position, which row or column they are associated with, and whether they
/// correspond to a variable or a constraint.
///
/// An unknown is addressed by its index. If the index i is non-negative, then
/// the variable var[i] is being addressed. If the index i is negative, then
/// the constraint con[~i] is being addressed. Effectively this maps
/// 0 -> var[0], 1 -> var[1], -1 -> con[0], -2 -> con[1], etc. rowUnknown[r] and
/// colUnknown[c] are the indexes of the unknowns associated with row r and
/// column c, respectively.
///
/// The unknowns in column position are together called the basis. Initially the
/// basis is the set of variables -- in our example above, the initial basis is
/// x, y.
///
/// The unknowns in row position are represented in terms of the basis unknowns.
/// If the basis unknowns are u_1, u_2, ... u_m, and a row in the tableau is
/// d, c, a_1, a_2, ... a_m, this representats the unknown for that row as
/// (c + a_1*u_1 + a_2*u_2 + ... + a_m*u_m)/d. In our running example, if the
/// basis is the initial basis of x, y, then the constraint 1 + 2x + 3y >= 0
/// would be represented by the row [1, 1, 2, 3].
///
/// The association of unknowns to rows and columns can be changed by a process
/// called pivoting, where a row unknown and a column unknown exchange places
/// and the remaining row variables' representation is changed accordingly
/// by eliminating the old column unknown in favour of the new column unknown.
/// If we had pivoted the column for x with the row for 2x - 3y >= 0,
/// the new row for x would be [2, 1, 3] since x = (1*(2x - 3y) + 3*y)/2.
/// See the documentation for the pivot member function for details.
///
/// The association of unknowns to rows and columns is called the _tableau
/// configuration_. The _sample value_ of an unknown in a particular tableau
/// configuration is its value if all the column unknowns were set to zero.
/// Concretely, for unknowns in column position the sample value is zero and
/// for unknowns in row position the sample value is the constant term divided
/// by the common denominator.
///
/// The tableau configuration is called _consistent_ if the sample value of all
/// restricted unknowns is non-negative. Initially there are no constraints, and
/// the tableau is consistent. When a new constraint is added, its sample value
/// in the current tableau configuration may be negative. In that case, we try
/// to find a series of pivots to bring us to a consistent tableau
/// configuration, i.e. we try to make the new constraint's sample value
/// non-negative without making that of any other constraints negative. (See
/// findPivot and findPivotRow for details.) If this is not possible, then the
/// set of constraints is mutually contradictory and the tableau is marked
/// _empty_, which means the set of constraints has no solution.
///
/// This Simplex class also supports taking snapshots of the current state
/// and rolling back to prior snapshots. This works by maintaing an undo log
/// of operations. Snapshots are just pointers to a particular location in the
/// log, and rolling back to a snapshot is done by reverting each log entry's
/// operation from the end until we reach the snapshot's location.
///
/// Finding an integer sample is done with the Generalized Basis Reduction
/// algorithm. See the documentation for findIntegerSample and reduceBasis.
